# AstroPut — Project Instructions

## Content Writing Rules

**When writing any content** (page copy, descriptions, blog posts, meta tags, MDX files, any user-facing text):

1. **Read the content rules file first**: `G:\My Drive\content-rules-sr.md`
2. Follow every rule in that file — tone, banned phrases, SEO structure, E-E-A-T, quality standards
3. Do NOT use any internal/local content rules — the Google Drive file is the single source of truth

This applies to all content in Serbian for this project. The rules file covers:
- Voice and tone guidelines
- Banned AI-marker phrases
- SEO keyword and structure requirements
- E-E-A-T compliance (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
- Google Helpful Content signals
- Pre-publish quality checklist
